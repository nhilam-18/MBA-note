# Long Term Assest 

## Long-Lived Asests Capitalization Capitalization
* Newly acquired long-lived asets capitalized/valuedd at cótt

* Acquisition Costs
    - All cost necessary to purchase, transport, and prepare asset to be productive 
    - Including: taxes, employee training, modifications to facilities

* Other capitalized costs
    - retooling costs and interest related to this retooling
    - Retooling interest is sdisclosed separately 

**Note:** All of these cost will go balance sheet 

## Maintenance vs. Betterment 

* Maintenance 
    - Routine
    - expensed on the income statement 

**Note:** Impact the income statement but not the balance sheet 

* Betterment
    - Non0routine
    - Capitalized on balance sheet
    - Criteria (meet one)
        - extends life, improves quality of product, reduces expense associate w/asset 

**Note:** when certaint thing get classify as income statement the cost get deducted that year. When it get on balance sheet, it will get deduct over time 

## Long-lived Assets Cost Allocation 
* Long-lived asset categories
    - Fixed assets
    - Intangible assets
    - Natural resources

* Long-lived asset cost are allocated over time assets are used or are productive 
    - Fixed assets: Depreciation 
    - Intangible: Amortization
    - Natural resources: Depletion 

## Cost Allocation Procss 
* Purpose to match cost with the revenue generated by asset's use 
    - Not the goal to mirror market value 
    - Regardless of method same total expense over time 
* Management must decide 
    - Method; Useful life; Salvage value 
* Companies can choose different methods for financial reporting and taxes
    - Straight-line for financial reporting 
    - MACRS for tax 

## Allocation Approaches for fixed Assets

### Straight-Line Method 

Allocates the capitalized cost of an asset equally over the expected productive life

Operating expense for one period = $\frac{1}{n}$(Acquisition cost - Residual value)

Where n = Asset’s expected useful life in months or years, and Residual value = Estimated amount the asset can be sold for at the end of its useful life

### Double-Declining Balance Method
Results in the asset to be depreciated at a faster rate than straight-line 

Operation expense for one period = $\frac{2}{n}$ (Book value)

`n = asset’s expected useful life in months or years`


### Units-of-Production Method

Relevant if the expected useful life is based on an asset’s usage rather than the passage of time.

Depreciation expense for one period  = $\frac{OutPutConsumeThisPeriod}{TotalEstimatedLifeTimeOutPut}$ (Aquisition Cost - Residual Value)
