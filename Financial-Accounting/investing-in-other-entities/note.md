### Equity Method 

* When parent has 20-50% ownership
    - Investor can exercise influence over investee
    - Under 50% means not enough to have voting control 
* Investment account on B/S equals: 
Investment account on b/s = original cost + proportionate share of net income/loss - proportionate share of dividends 

`` Share of net income treated as earnings to investor``

`` Share of dividends treated as return of capital ( not earnings)``

    - Investor has voting control 
    - Single set of financial statement for combined companies
    - Referred to as purchase accounting

    - Goodwill is present 
    - Parent must adjust assets and liabilities to the fair market values on the consolidated balance sheet 

## Marketable Securities 
* Either debt or equity securities 
    - Trading, Available-for-sale, or Held-to-maturity are three possible accounting treatments
